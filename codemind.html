		<h3>CODEMIND - A Platform for Future Coding</h3><br>Code Mind is a platform that focuses on crafting a skilled individual. Our unique and interactive scenario based learning modules are designed to help a student look at a problem in a life like perspective. We strongly believe that every mind isnâ€™t alike, and therefore we give the student a chance to express their opinion rather than trying to abide by a generalized one. The platform also guides students on how they should proceed with their goals and helps them prepare for their dream job in a personalized way.
