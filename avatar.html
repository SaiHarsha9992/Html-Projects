		Avatar: The Way of Water is a 2022 American epic science fiction film directed by James Cameron from a screenplay he co-wrote with Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver, with a story the trio wrote with Josh Friedman and Shane Salerno. Produced by Lightstorm Entertainment and TSG Entertainment, and distributed by 20th Century Studios, it is the sequel to Avatar (2009) and the second film in the Avatar franchise. Cast members Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldaña, Stephen Lang, Joel David Moore, CCH Pounder, Giovanni Ribisi, Dileep Rao, and Matt Gerald reprise their roles from the original film, with Sigourney Weaver returning in a different role.[6] New cast members include Kate Winslet, Cliff Curtis, Edie Falco, and Jemaine Clement. In the film, Jake Sully (Worthington) and his family, under renewed threat from humans, seek refuge with the Metkayina clan of Pandora.

        Cameron stated in 2006 that he would like to make sequels to Avatar if it was successful, and announced the first two sequels in 2010, following the widespread success of the first film, with the first sequel aiming for a 2014 release.[7][8] However, the addition of two more sequels, for a total of five Avatar films, and the necessity to develop new technology in order to film performance capture scenes underwater, a feat never accomplished before, led to significant delays to allow the crew more time to work on the writing, preproduction, and visual effects.[9] The filming process, which occurred simultaneously with a currently untitled third film, began in Manhattan Beach, California, on August 15, 2017. The filming location moved to Wellington, New Zealand on September 25, 2017, and concluded in late September 2020 after three years of shooting. With an estimated budget of $350–460 million, it is one of the most expensive films ever made.</font>

Following repeated delays in the expected release schedule, Avatar: The Way of Water premiered in London on December 6, 2022, and was theatrically released in the United States on December 16, 2022. The film has grossed over $661 million worldwide, becoming the eighth highest-grossing film of 2022, and received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised Cameron's direction, cast performances, emotional weight, worldbuilding, visual effects and technical achievements but felt that it had a thin narrative and criticized its length.[10][11] Organizations such as the National Board of Review and the American Film Institute named Avatar: The Way of Water as one of the top ten films of 2022. The film also received numerous other accolades, including nominations for the Best Motion Picture – Drama and Best Director at the 80th Golden Globe Awards.</font>

More than a decade after the Na'vi repelled the human invasion of Pandora,[a] Jake Sully lives as chief of the Omaticaya clan and raises a family with Neytiri, which includes sons Neteyam and Lo'ak, daughter Tuk, adopted daughter Kiri (born from Grace Augustine's inert avatar), and a human boy named Spider, the son of Colonel Miles Quaritch who was born on Pandora and was unable to be transported to Earth in cryostasis due to his young age. To the Na'vi's dismay, the humans return and erect a new main operating base named Bridgehead City to prepare Pandora for colonization, as Earth is dying. Among the new arrivals are recombinants, Na'vi avatars implanted with the minds and memories of deceased RDA marines, with Quaritch's recombinant as their leader.</font>
<font style="color: blue">
Jake initiates a guerilla campaign against the RDA supply lines. Quaritch and his recombinants conduct a counterinsurgency mission against Jake, capturing his children. Jake and Neytiri arrive and free most of them, but Spider is taken by Quaritch, who recognizes him as his son. He decides to spend time with him in order to draw Spider on his side, and in turn, Spider teaches Quaritch about Na'vi culture and language. Aware of the danger Spider's knowledge of his whereabouts poses to their safety, Jake and his family exile themselves from the Omaticaya and retreat to the Metkayina reef people clan at Pandora's eastern seaboard, where they are given shelter, even though some tribesmen consider them to have "demon blood" for their genetic human heritage. The family learns the ways of the reef people, Kiri develops a spiritual bond with the sea and its creatures, and Lo'ak befriends Tsireya, the daughter of clan chief Tonowari and his wife Ronal.</font></font>
